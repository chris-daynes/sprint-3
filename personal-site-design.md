#Website Designing: Big questions to ask early.

**1. What is your site's main purpose?**

The main purpose of my site is to show case the work that I undertake during the EDA bootcamp.
Of this work the stuff that is really important will be the projects ie things that I have created. The blog stuff is secondary the project work. Especially when it comes to others seeing what I have and can do.

**2. Who's is your target audience?**

My target audience are those who I want to show my ideas and capibilites to. Not really future empolyers as such as I am not looking for a job but I may want collaborators to future projects etc. I am also my audience, as I want to look back at my work and see how and what I may have achieved.

**3. How do you want site visitors to interact with your site? What experience would you like them to have?**

I would like them to shuffle through project work with ease. Given the way things are with mobile these days this must be easy and aesthetically pleasing on both mobile and desktop screen size. The experience has got to be ease and usability.

**4. How will you build your site to support your desired user experience?**

It must be easy to navigate. Navigation should be intuitive and obvious. Make it simple and de-cluttered.
